# Iron Signs (Fabric and NeoForge)  

Iron Signs themselves are not much better than Vanilla wooden signs. They are inexpensive, and stack up to 64, but they are just dull gray, slightly rusted pieces of iron plates.

Their crafting recipes are similar to the Vanilla wooden signs:

But Iron Signs can be painted to all the colors of Minecraft:

![Painting a Yellow Sign](./images/painting_yellow_sign.png "Painting a Yellow Sign")

Or, even more efficiently, at the time of their creation:

![Crafting a Yellow Sign](./images/crafting_yellow_sign.png "Crafting a Yellow Sign")

The vibrant, high contrast, painted signs then can be used to convey information to your friends:

Or to your enemies:

Or to your customers:

Since 1.0.2 with sign text coloring and formatting:
